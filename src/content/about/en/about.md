I am a 25 years old Full Stack Developer from Rio Negro, Argentina ðŸ§‰, and since I was a child I have been passionate about **technology**. My journey into the tech world has been shaped by a diverse range of experiences:  
Initially, I pursued two years of studies in both **Systems Engineering** and **Psychology** before facing personal challenges that led to a pause in my formal education.  
Subsequently, I immersed myself in **Esports**, leveraging **self-taught tools** to provide **applications, websites, and statistical analysis** to professional Esports teams. This culminated in my tenure at Infinity Esports, a prominent organization in the Latin American Esports scene.  
Currently, my focus is on building a career as a **Full Stack Developer**. Leveraging my academic background, supplemented by relevant courseworks, as well as both freelance and self-taught studies, I am actively pursuing opportunities to further enhance my skills and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.
