    <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base lg:text-xl xl:text-base 2xl:text-base">
      I am a 25 years old Full Stack Developer from Rio Negro, Argentina ðŸ§‰, 
      and since I was a child I have been passionate about 
      <span class="text-[#88d2fd]/90 font-semibold">technology</span>.
      My journey into the tech world has been shaped by a diverse range of experiences:
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base lg:text-xl xl:text-base 2xl:text-base">
      Initially, I pursued two years of studies in both 
      <span class="text-[#88d2fd]/90 font-semibold">Systems Engineering</span> 
      and <span class="text-[#88d2fd]/90 font-semibold">Psychology</span> 
      before facing personal challenges that led to a pause in my formal education.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base lg:text-xl xl:text-base 2xl:text-base">
      Subsequently, I immersed myself in 
      <span class="text-[#88d2fd]/90 font-semibold">Esports</span>, 
      leveraging <span class="text-[#88d2fd]/90 font-semibold">self-taught tools</span> 
      to provide <span class="text-[#88d2fd]/90 font-semibold">applications, websites, and statistical analysis</span> 
      to professional Esports teams. This culminated in my tenure at Infinity Esports, 
      a prominent organization in the Latin American Esports scene.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-sm sm:text-base lg:text-xl xl:text-base 2xl:text-base">
      Currently, my focus is on building a career as a 
      <span class="text-[#88d2fd]/90 font-semibold">Full Stack Developer</span>. 
      Leveraging my academic background, supplemented by relevant coursework including training at Coderhouse, 
      as well as both freelance and self-taught studies, 
      I am actively pursuing opportunities to further enhance my skills and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.
